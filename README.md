# Flask-ActivityPub

Flask-ActivityPub is a Flask extension that should enable the developer to add social networking [ActivityPub](http://activitypub.rocks/) support to a Flask application. This could be the main purpose of the application, or could be implemented in a blueprint as a subsection (examples coming later).

It's WAY EARLY days and there is little code yet, though reading [tests.py](./tests.py) might be of use. Please Stand By.

### Acknowledgements

I've learned a lot of this from [Rowan](https://github.com/rowanlupton) esp from reading the [Smilodon](https://github.com/rowanlupton/smilodon) source code, tiny bits of which I've literally copied and pasted while trying to make things work. Additionally, I'm learning a lot from [Christian Webber](https://github.com/cwebber) and his ActivityStreams work with https://github.com/w3-social/activipy.
