# Flask-ActivityPub

Flask-ActivityPub is a Flask extension that should enable the developer to add social networking [ActivityPub](http://activitypub.rocks/) support to a Flask application. This could be the main purpose of the application, or could be implemented in a blueprint as a subsection (examples coming later).

It's WAY EARLY days and there is little code yet, though reading [tests.py](./tests.py) might be of use. Please Stand By.
