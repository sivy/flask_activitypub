# Flask-ActivityPub

Flask-ActivityPub is a Flask extension that should enable the developer to add [ActivityPub](http://activitypub.rocks/) support to a FLask application. THis could be the main purpose of the application, or coud be implemented in a blueprint (examples coming later).

It's WAY EARLY days and there is little code yet, though reading [tests.py](./tests.py) might be of use. Please Stand By.
